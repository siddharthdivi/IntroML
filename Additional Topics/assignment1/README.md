In this assignment you will be working on the following modules : 

- **kNN** 
- **Softmax**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
- **Two Layer Neural Network**


**Download data:**
Once you have the starter code, you will need to download the CIFAR-10 dataset.
Run the following from the `assignment1` directory:

```bash
cd cs231n/datasets
./get_datasets.sh
```

**Start IPython:**
After you have the CIFAR-10 data, you should start the IPython notebook server
from the `assignment1` directory. 
 
### k-Nearest Neighbor Classifier. 
The IPython notebook `knn.ipynb` will walk you through implementing the kNN classifier.

### Training a Support Vector Machine.
The IPython notebook `svm.ipynb` will walk you through implementing the SVM classifier.

### Implement a Softmax Classifier.
The IPython notebook `softmax.ipynb` will walk you through implementing the Softmax Classifier.

### Two-Layer Neural Network
The IPython Notebook `two_layer_net.ipynb` will walk you through the  implementation of a two-layer neural network classifier.

### Higher Level Representations : Image Features
The IPython Notebook `features.ipynb` will walk you through this exercise, in which you will examine the improvements gained by using higher-level representations as opposed to using raw pixel values.

**NOTE**
The Ipython notebooks also require you to complete the code in certain functions which are also present in this folder. Comments are present to show the are where you're supposed to add your code.
